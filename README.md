# LOUD-Bot
 * Development of the LOUD Mining Discord Bot
 * **Original Author**: [LOUD-Mining](https://github.com/LOUD-Mining/)
 * :star: **Contributor**: [Nugetzrul3](https://github.com/Nugetzrul3/)


### Dependencies:

  * NodeJS 14.7.0 or later --- Seriously, this app was built using this version, it may or may not work "out of the box" on earlier versions.
    * use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/) to install and manage NodeJS the easy way!
  
  * MySQL 8.0.21 or later  --- This is necessary to make the mystats command work as we need to store user data and fetch it later.


### Install Instructions:

  ```# adduser --disabled-password botusername```
